# CMP configurable reference

This example application shows how to use the CMP Peripheral library to compare voltage level on the negative input with the internal configurable reference voltage.

## Description

The peripheral named comparator voltage reference (CVR) can be used by the CMP peripheral. It generates a voltage that can be connected internally to the +ve input of the any of the comparators in the device. This allows to set flexible compare voltages.

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with FPU (EF) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320007)

- Connect mini USB cables from the ‘Debug USB’ and ‘USB-to-UART’ connectors on the board to the computer
- Pin 8 (C1IND) on J12 is the negative input. Connect it to a voltage below the reference voltage (~2V from CVR peripheral) to trigger interrupt

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Following message is output on console:
