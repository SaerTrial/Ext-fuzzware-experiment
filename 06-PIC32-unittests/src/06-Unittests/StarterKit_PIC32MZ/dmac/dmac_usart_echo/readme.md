# DMAC usart echo

This example application demonstrates USART transfer with DMA to receive 10 bytes and echo back the received bytes

## Description

This application demonstrates USART transfer with DMA using SERCOM peripheral configured in USART mode. One DMA channel is used to receive 10 bytes of data from the USART and another DMA channel is used to echo back the received bytes.

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with FPU (EF) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320007)

- Connect mini USB cables from the ‘Debug USB’ and ‘USB-to-UART’ connectors on the board to the computer

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Following message is output on console:

   ![output](images/output_dmac_usart_echo.png)

5. Type 10 characters in the terminal. It will echo back the received bytes and toggles the LED

The following table provides the LED name:

| Board | LED name |
