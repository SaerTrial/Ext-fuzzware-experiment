# ICAP capture mode

This example application shows how to use the ICAP peripheral to measure the pulse width of the input signal.

## Description

In this application, a pulse signal is generated using the OCMP peripheral and is fed to the ICAP input. ICAP peripheral captures the time at every edge and displays the pulse width on the serial terminal.

## Downloading and building the application
