# ADC interrupt

This example demonstrates how to sample an analog input in interrupt mode and send the converted data to console.

## Description

In this example, Analog input voltage in the range of 0 V to 3.3 V is fed to the ADC and converted value is displayed on the console. The ADC conversion is triggered by software and result is read in the conversion complete interrupt handler.

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up [Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320103)

- Connect mini USB cable to the 'Debug USB' connector(J3) on the board to the computer
- Install an [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) on to the mikroBUS socket J5
- Connect mini USB cable to the [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click). This will enumerate the USB to UART port
- AN9 pin is used for analog input
- Use a jumper wire to connect Pin 3 of J14 (AN9 is mapped to Port Pin RPB9) to 3.3 V or GND or external supply
  *Note: Ensure that the series resistors on the mikroBUS headers are of value 0 Ohms*

### Setting up [PIC32MX274 XLP Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320105)

- Connect micro USB cable to the 'Debug USB' connector(J9) on the board to the computer
- Install an [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) on to the mikroBUS socket J5
- Connect mini USB cable to the [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) (This will enumerate the USB to UART port)
- AN7 pin, which is coming on switches S1 to S5, is used for analog input

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console displays the ADC count and the ADC input voltage
